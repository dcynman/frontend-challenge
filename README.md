An urban transit app for mobile (mockup)

This was an illuminating project. Though it did not include every step of the initial design process, it was the most cumulative so far. The thematic continuity allowed me to dig deeper into the user’s experience with public transit. From a meta perspective, it also enabled me to better understand the design process and how shortcomings in one domain might influence the next. For example, had I not prioritized my user stories, scope creep might have set in--I might have designed a very cool app that didn’t broach the primary goal: 
to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. This project was meaningul in that it plainly showed the pull of scope creep, the diversity of user experiences and opinions, and lastly, the meticulous thought that fluid design requires.
